  intro: `PROBLEM SOLVING AND STORYTELLING.

Everything starts with a question: What are we doing here? Once we agree on the task, I lay out a plan. You need clarity, the right perspective, and the right people. When we've got those, we're halfway there.

Too often, projects get tangled in too many hands, wasted time, and money spent. Budgets grow, meetings multiply, and the focus shifts from solving the problem to justifying the invoices.

I do the work like it's mine. If I'm not the man for the job, I'll say so. I don't drag things out to look busy. I don't bill by the hour. I charge by the solution.

WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?`,

  bio: [
    "After working with projects and companies big and small, I've gotten good at figuring out the problem and solving it. Setting the direction and finding the right people. What the modern creative business loves – workshops, cheap talk, fetishising the processes – is what I steer away from. I design solutions that outlast me.",
    "Drawn to simple things that last, both in work and in life. Inspired by photography, internet's early and future days, crafty people, unorthodox thinking and big trees.",
    "Lives and works from Helsinki, Finland."
